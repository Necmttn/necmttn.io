  testimonial: Simon and his team at Xanthous Tech have raised the bar for a development firm. They consistently deliver incredible results and at lightning speeds. They're also a joy to work with. Unlike other development firms, you have complete transparency into their process, and can see every code commit and track every minute. They have deep experience with Serverless framework, React, Next.JS, GatsbyJS, APIs and Modern DevOps that I haven't found anywhere else. I've almost wanted to keep them a secret because they're that good. You can stop looking for developers, Xanthous is the best you'll find anywhere.
